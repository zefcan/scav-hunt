                    <h2 class="section-heading">Welcome</h2>
                    
                    <p>In January 2017 we decided to run a second scavenger hunt at South Bank. We had to come up with a set of all new items different from the first hunt, so this time we went all out, including more activities and videos and also added the Gallery of Modern Art and Queensland Art Gallery to the lineup of areas. It went really well and so we decided we'd turn it into an annual event for the time being.</p>
                    <p>You'll find a DIY Scavenger Hunt Kit below which has everything you need to replicate the second ever Golden Dinosaur Scavenger Hunt.</p>
					<h2 class="section-heading">The 2016 DIY Scavenger Hunt Kit</h2>
					<p> The following kit explains what we did and has everything you need to run your own version of the hunt. It includes:
					<ol>
						<li>Instructions for organisers</li>
						<li>Rules for players and list of items to find
						<li>Team registration sheet
						<li>Scoring sheets for judges
						<li>List of answers 
						<li>List of clues
					</ol>

					<h2 class="section-heading">The 2017 Hunt</h2>
					<p>This was the second scavenger hunt we ran in South Bank and it worked really well. We created 29 brand new items for the hunt and also expanded the hunt to include GOMA and QAG. We only added one thing to the rules - teams could ask for up to 3 hints and no more. This made the hint system more understandable this time around as there was confusion around it last year.</p>
					<p>We kept it as a digital hunt, which meant that players used their phone to collect and submit hunt items to judges who then told them if they were correct or not. The submissions were either a text answer, a photo or a video. This meant that nothing had to be set up and we had a collection of great photos and videos to remember the day with.</p> 
					<p>Here's a few example items from this year's hunt:
					<ul>
						<li>Head to Streets Beach and give us your best baywatch slo-mo beach run.</li>
						<li>Uh oh, your invisible bicycle has a flat tire! Find a repair station and show us you fixing it.</li>
						<li>Enter through the gift shop and find the animal toys. Give us your best David Attenborough narration.</li>
						<li>Fruit Ninja! Each group member must pose with a different fruit plant.</li>
						<li>Challenge a stranger to a game of scissors paper rock. Show us who won.</li>
						
					</ul>
